    "### 1. What is the difference between `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__`?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, both `__getattr__` and `__getattribute__` are special methods that are called when an attribute of an object is accessed. However, they serve different purposes and are invoked under different circumstances. Here's the difference between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`__getattr__`**: `__getattr__` is a fallback method invoked when an attribute that doesn't exist is accessed. It is only called when the requested attribute is not found through the usual lookup mechanism (i.e., not found as an instance attribute or in the class hierarchy). You can use `__getattr__` to dynamically create or compute attributes on the fly when they are accessed for the first time.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class MyClass:\n",
    "         def __getattr__(self, name):\n",
    "             return f\"Attribute {name} not found\"\n",
    "     \n",
    "     obj = MyClass()\n",
    "     print(obj.foo)  # Output: Attribute foo not found\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`__getattribute__`**: `__getattribute__` is a more powerful method that is called every time an attribute is accessed, regardless of whether the attribute exists or not. It intercepts all attribute access attempts, including built-in methods and attributes. You can override `__getattribute__` to implement custom behavior for attribute access, but you must be cautious to avoid infinite recursion by accessing other attributes within the implementation. If you want to access the attribute normally within `__getattribute__`, you should use the base class implementation via `super().__getattribute__(name)`.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class MyClass:\n",
    "         def __getattribute__(self, name):\n",
    "             print(f\"Accessing attribute: {name}\")\n",
    "             return super().__getattribute__(name)\n",
    "     \n",
    "     obj = MyClass()\n",
    "     obj.foo  # Output: Accessing attribute: foo\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "In summary, `__getattr__` is invoked only when an attribute is not found through the usual lookup, while `__getattribute__` intercepts all attribute access attempts, regardless of whether the attribute exists or not. Use `__getattr__` for dynamic attribute creation or computation, and use `__getattribute__` for more advanced attribute access interception and customization."

    "### 2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties and descriptors are both mechanisms in Python that allow you to manage attribute access and manipulation, but they serve different purposes and have different levels of flexibility and control. Here's the difference between properties and descriptors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Properties**: Properties are a high-level, built-in feature of Python that allow you to define special methods to control attribute access, similar to getters and setters in other programming languages. Properties are defined using the `property()` function or the `@property` decorator. They are typically used to implement computed attributes or to provide controlled access to instance variables. Properties are associated with a specific attribute name within a class, and they are accessed using dot notation.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class MyClass:\n",
    "         def __init__(self):\n",
    "             self._x = None\n",
    "     \n",
    "         @property\n",
    "         def x(self):\n",
    "             return self._x\n",
    "     \n",
    "         @x.setter\n",
    "         def x(self, value):\n",
    "             self._x = value\n",
    "     \n",
    "     obj = MyClass()\n",
    "     obj.x = 10  # Setter called\n",
    "     print(obj.x)  # Getter called: Output: 10\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Descriptors**: Descriptors are a lower-level protocol in Python that allows you to define classes with special methods (`__get__`, `__set__`, and `__delete__`) to customize attribute access. Descriptors are defined as separate classes and can be reused across multiple attributes and classes. They provide more flexibility and control over attribute access than properties, as they can intercept access to multiple attributes and implement custom behavior based on the attribute name or other criteria. Descriptors are typically used for more complex attribute management scenarios or when you need to enforce specific behaviors across multiple attributes or classes.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class Descriptor:\n",
    "         def __get__(self, instance, owner):\n",
    "             return instance._x\n",
    "     \n",
    "         def __set__(self, instance, value):\n",
    "             instance._x = value\n",
    "     \n",
    "     class MyClass:\n",
    "         x = Descriptor()\n",
    "     \n",
    "     obj = MyClass()\n",
    "     obj.x = 10  # Descriptor's __set__ method called\n",
    "     print(obj.x)  # Descriptor's __get__ method called: Output: 10\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "In summary, properties are a high-level feature that provides a convenient way to define attribute access behavior within a class, while descriptors offer a more flexible and powerful mechanism for customizing attribute access at a lower level. Properties are associated with specific attribute names, while descriptors can be shared and reused across multiple attributes and classes. Properties are simpler to use for basic cases, while descriptors offer more control and customization options for advanced scenarios."
