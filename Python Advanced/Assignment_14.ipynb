    "   >>> import your_module\n",

    "### 9. How do you distinguish between a wrapper, a wrapped feature, and a decorator?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, particularly in object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, \"wrapper,\" \"wrapped feature,\" and \"decorator\" are terms often used to describe different concepts related to adding functionality to existing code or objects. Here's how they can be distinguished:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Wrapper:** A wrapper is a design pattern used to encapsulate and modify the behavior of an object or a function without changing its interface. It involves creating a new class or function that contains the original object or function and provides additional functionality around it. The wrapper does not alter the original object or function; instead, it adds some functionality before or after the original behavior is executed. Wrappers are commonly used for adding logging, caching, error handling, or other cross-cutting concerns to existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wrapped Feature:** This term typically refers to the original object or function that is being modified or enhanced. It represents the core functionality that remains unchanged by wrappers or decorators. The wrapped feature is the entity around which wrappers or decorators operate, adding functionality or altering behavior while keeping the core functionality intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decorator:** A decorator is a specific type of wrapper in Python, commonly used to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods. Decorators are higher-order functions that take a function as input and return a new function that usually enhances or modifies the behavior of the original function. They are applied using the `@decorator_name` syntax in Python, where `decorator_name` is the name of the decorator function. Decorators are frequently used for adding cross-cutting concerns such as logging, caching, authentication, or performance monitoring to functions or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while wrappers and decorators share similarities in the sense that they both add functionality to existing code, decorators are a specific type of wrapper commonly used in Python for modifying the behavior of functions or methods using a specific syntax. Wrapped features, on the other hand, represent the core functionality that remains unchanged by wrappers or decorators."
