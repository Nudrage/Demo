    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing and slicing are both techniques used to access elements or portions of a sequence, such as lists, strings, or tuples, in Python. While they both involve accessing elements, they differ in terms of granularity and the number of elements they retrieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Indexing**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Indexing refers to accessing a single element from a sequence at a specific position.\n",
    "   - **Syntax**: Indexing is done using square brackets (`[]`) with an integer index inside.\n",
    "   - **Behavior**: When you index a sequence, you retrieve a single element located at the specified index.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
    "     print(my_list[2])  # Output: 30\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Slicing**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Slicing refers to accessing a contiguous sequence of elements from a sequence.\n",
    "   - **Syntax**: Slicing is done using slice notation `[start:stop:step]`, where `start` is the starting index (inclusive), `stop` is the stopping index (exclusive), and `step` is the step size (optional).\n",
    "   - **Behavior**: When you slice a sequence, you retrieve a portion of the sequence specified by the range of indices provided.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",

    "### 5. What happens if one of the slicing expression&#39;s indexes is out of range?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If one of the slicing expression's indexes is out of range, Python does not raise an error; instead, it handles the situation gracefully by adjusting the index to the nearest valid value. The behavior depends on whether the out-of-range index is used as a start index, stop index, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start Index Out of Range**:\n",
    "   - If the start index is out of range (i.e., it is greater than the length of the sequence), Python sets the start index to the beginning of the sequence. This behavior allows you to start the slice from the beginning of the sequence if the specified start index exceeds the sequence's length.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "     print(my_list[10:])  # Output: []\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stop Index Out of Range**:\n",
    "   - If the stop index is out of range (i.e., it is greater than the length of the sequence), Python sets the stop index to the end of the sequence. This behavior allows you to slice up to the end of the sequence if the specified stop index exceeds the sequence's length.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "     print(my_list[:10])  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Both Start and Stop Indexes Out of Range**:\n",
    "   - If both the start and stop indexes are out of range, Python still handles the situation by slicing from the beginning to the end of the sequence.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
