    "### 1. What are the two latest user-defined exception constraints in Python 3.X?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python 3.x, user-defined exceptions can be defined by creating custom exception classes. While there aren't specific constraints imposed on user-defined exceptions, two common conventions or best practices are often followed when defining custom exception classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inheriting from `Exception` class**: Custom exception classes should typically inherit from the built-in `Exception` class or one of its subclasses. By inheriting from `Exception`, custom exceptions become compatible with the existing exception hierarchy in Python, making them consistent with built-in exceptions.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "         pass\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Descriptive and Meaningful Naming**: Custom exception classes should have descriptive and meaningful names that reflect the nature of the exceptional condition being raised. Choose names that provide clarity and convey the purpose or cause of the exception.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class InvalidInputError(Exception):\n",
    "         pass\n",
    "     ```"

    "### 2. How are class-based exceptions that have been raised matched to handlers?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, when a class-based exception is raised, the interpreter searches for an appropriate exception handler to handle the exception. The matching process involves searching through the except clauses in a `try` statement to find a handler that matches the type of the raised exception or one of its base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how class-based exceptions are matched to handlers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Checking `except` Clauses**:\n",
    "   - When an exception is raised, Python starts searching for an appropriate handler by checking each `except` clause in the nearest enclosing `try` statement, starting from the top and moving downwards.\n",
    "   - Each `except` clause specifies an exception type or a tuple of exception types that it can handle. If the raised exception matches any of these types, the corresponding block of code is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Matching based on Exception Type**:\n",
    "   - To determine whether a raised exception matches an `except` clause, Python checks whether the raised exception is an instance of the specified exception type or one of its base classes.\n",
    "   - If the raised exception is an instance of the specified type or a subclass of it, the corresponding `except` block is considered a match, and its associated code is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Order of `except` Clauses**:\n",
    "   - The order of `except` clauses matters. Python matches exceptions from top to bottom, so if multiple `except` clauses can handle the same exception, only the first matching `except` clause encountered during the search will be executed.\n",
    "   - Therefore, more specific exception types should be placed before more general ones to ensure that they are matched first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example demonstrating the matching process:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "    raise ValueError(\"An error occurred\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    # This except block will handle ValueError and its subclasses\n",
    "    print(\"Handling ValueError\")\n",
    "except Exception:\n",
    "    # This except block will handle any other exceptions\n",
    "    print(\"Handling other exceptions\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, if a `ValueError` is raised, the first `except` block will handle it because `ValueError` is a subclass of `Exception`. If a different exception type, such as `TypeError`, is raised, the second `except` block will handle it because it's a more general handler for all exceptions not caught by the first block."

    "### 3. Describe two methods for attaching context information to exception artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, attaching context information to exception artifacts can be crucial for debugging and understanding the cause of exceptions. Here are two methods commonly used to attach context information to exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using the `args` Attribute**: The `args` attribute of an exception object can be used to store additional context information about the exception. When creating a custom exception or raising an exception, you can pass context information as arguments to the exception constructor. These arguments are stored in the `args` attribute of the exception object.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "         pass\n",
    "\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "         ...\n",
    "         raise CustomError(\"Additional context information\")\n",
    "     except CustomError as e:\n",
    "         # Accessing the context information stored in the args attribute\n",
    "         print(\"Exception:\", e)\n",
    "         print(\"Context:\", e.args)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using Custom Attributes**: You can define custom attributes in your custom exception classes to store specific context information related to the exception. By defining custom attributes, you have more control over the structure and organization of the context information associated with the exception.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "         def __init__(self, message, context):\n",
    "             super().__init__(message)\n",
    "             self.context = context\n",
    "\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "         ...\n",
    "         raise CustomError(\"Custom error message\", {\"key\": \"value\"})\n",
    "     except CustomError as e:\n",
    "         # Accessing the context information stored in custom attributes\n",
    "         print(\"Exception:\", e)\n",
    "         print(\"Context:\", e.context)\n",
    "     ```"

    "### 4. Describe two methods for specifying the text of an exception object's error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are several methods for specifying the text of an exception object's error message. Here are two common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using the Exception Constructor**: When raising a built-in or custom exception, you can specify the error message directly as an argument to the exception constructor. This method allows you to provide a descriptive error message that explains the cause of the exception.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Raising a built-in exception with a custom error message\n",
    "     raise ValueError(\"Invalid input value\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Raising a custom exception with a custom error message\n",
    "     class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "         pass\n",
    "\n",
    "     raise CustomError(\"Custom error message\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overriding the `__str__` Method**: When defining a custom exception class, you can override the `__str__` method to customize the error message returned by the exception object when it is converted to a string. By overriding `__str__`, you can provide dynamic error messages based on the state of the exception object or other factors.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "         def __init__(self, code):\n",
    "             self.code = code\n",
    "\n",
    "         def __str__(self):\n",
    "             return f\"Custom error with code {self.code}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Raising a custom exception with a dynamic error message\n",
    "     raise CustomError(123)\n",

    "### 5. Why do you no longer use string-based exceptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using string-based exceptions in Python is discouraged because it lacks several advantages provided by using exception classes. Here are some reasons why string-based exceptions are no longer preferred:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lack of Structure and Typing**: String-based exceptions do not provide any structure or typing information. This makes it difficult for developers to categorize and handle exceptions effectively based on their types.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Limited Information**: String-based exceptions only contain a message string, which may not provide sufficient information to understand the cause of the exception. Exception classes, on the other hand, can include additional attributes to store relevant data or context information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Difficulty in Exception Handling**: Handling string-based exceptions can be error-prone, as it requires comparing error messages as strings, which can be brittle and prone to typos or changes in wording."
