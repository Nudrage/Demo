    "Referring to groups by name rather than by number in a standard regular expression offers several benefits:\n",
    "\n",

If you need to modify the pattern later on, you can refer to groups by their names rather than relying on their numerical indices. This makes it less error-prone, as you don't have to recompute group indices if the pattern changes.\n",
