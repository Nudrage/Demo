    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, encapsulation, which involves hiding the implementation details of a class and providing access to data only through well-defined interfaces, is primarily achieved through conventions rather than strict enforcement by the language itself. Python supports encapsulation to a certain extent through the following mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Naming Conventions**:\n",
    "   - Python uses naming conventions to indicate the visibility of attributes and methods. By convention, attributes and methods prefixed with a single underscore (`_`) are considered as \"protected\" and should be treated as non-public parts of the API.  Attributes and methods prefixed with two underscores (`__`) are considered \"private\" and are subject to name mangling, making them harder to access from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Name Mangling**:\n",
    "   - Attributes and methods prefixed with double underscores (`__`) undergo name mangling, where their names are transformed to include the class name as a prefix followed by the double underscores. This mechanism provides a level of protection for class variables by making them less accessible from outside the class hierarchy. However, it does not entirely prevent access; it just makes it more difficult."

Each instance of the class has its own copy of instance variables, and changes made to one instance's variables do not affect other instances. Instance variables are accessed and modified using the instance name followed by the dot operator (`.`).\n",
