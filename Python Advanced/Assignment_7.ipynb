    "### 1. What is the purpose of the try statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the `try` statement in Python is to enable exception handling. It allows you to define a block of code where exceptions may occur and specify how to handle those exceptions gracefully. The `try` statement works together with the `except`, `else`, and `finally` clauses to manage exceptions effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an overview of the components of the `try` statement and their purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`try` block**: The `try` block encloses the code that you want to monitor for exceptions. Any exceptions that occur within this block are caught by the `try` statement.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **`except` block**: The `except` block immediately follows the `try` block and contains code to handle specific exceptions that may occur within the `try` block. You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions separately. If an exception occurs in the `try` block that matches the type specified in an `except` block, the code within that `except` block is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`else` block**: The `else` block is optional and follows the `except` block(s). It contains code that is executed only if no exceptions occur in the `try` block. The `else` block is useful for code that should run only when the `try` block executes successfully without raising any exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`finally` block**: The `finally` block is optional and follows the `except` and/or `else` blocks. It contains cleanup code that is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs in the `try` block. The `finally` block is useful for releasing resources, closing files, or performing any cleanup tasks that should be executed regardless of exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic example illustrating the usage of the `try` statement:"

    "### 2. What are the two most popular try statement variations?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most popular variations of the `try` statement in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic `try` statement with `except` block(s)**: This variation consists of a `try` block followed by one or more `except` blocks to handle specific exceptions that may occur within the `try` block.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "         result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "     except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "         # Handle the specific exception\n",
    "         print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`try` statement with `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks**: This variation extends the basic `try` statement by adding an `else` block and/or a `finally` block. The `else` block contains code that runs only if no exceptions occur in the `try` block. The `finally` block contains cleanup code that always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     try:\n",
    "         # Code that may raise an exception\n",
    "         result = 10 / 2  # This will not raise an exception\n",
    "     except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "         # Handle the specific exception\n",
    "         print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "     else:\n",
    "         # Code that runs only if no exceptions occur\n",
    "         print(\"Division successful\")\n",
    "     finally:\n",

    "### 3. What is the purpose of the raise statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `raise` statement in Python is used to explicitly raise exceptions. Its primary purpose is to signal that an exceptional condition has occurred during the execution of a program. When you raise an exception using the `raise` statement, you interrupt the normal flow of execution and transfer control to an appropriate exception handler. The `raise` statement allows you to indicate exceptional conditions in your code by raising exceptions, enabling you to handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate error messages or responses to users or other parts of your program."

    "### 4. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it like?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `assert` statement in Python is used to test whether a given expression evaluates to `True`. It is primarily used for debugging purposes and to check for conditions that should always be true during the execution of a program. If the expression provided to the `assert` statement evaluates to `False`, an `AssertionError` exception is raised, indicating that an unexpected condition has occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "assert x == 10, \"Value of x should be 10\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the value of `x` is not equal to 10, the `assert` statement will raise an `AssertionError` with the message \"Value of x should be 10\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The `assert` statement is similar to the `if` statement in terms of testing conditions, but it is intended for scenarios where certain conditions are expected to be true during development and should not occur in production code. While `if` statements are used for conditional execution of code based on runtime conditions, `assert` statements are used for sanity checks and to catch logical errors during development.It's important to note that `assert` statements can be disabled globally by running Python with the `-O` (optimize) flag, which turns off assertions. Therefore, `assert` statements should not be used for data validation or error handling in production code, as they may be silently ignored in optimized environments. Instead, use `if` statements and raise appropriate exceptions for error handling in production code."

    "### 5. What is the purpose of the with/as argument, and what other statement is it like?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement, often used in conjunction with the `as` clause, is used in Python for resource management, particularly for handling resources that require cleanup or releasing after use. It ensures that cleanup actions are performed automatically, even if exceptions occur during the execution of the block of code. The purpose of the `with/as` argument is to create a context manager, which is an object that manages the acquisition and release of resources. The `with` statement acquires the resource at the beginning of the block and releases it automatically at the end of the block, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. The `as` clause is optional and is used to assign the result of the `with` statement to a variable. This is commonly used when working with context managers that return objects or values that you want to use within the block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    data = file.read()\n",
    "    # Process the file contents\n",
    "\n",
    "# The file is automatically closed at the end of the block\n",
