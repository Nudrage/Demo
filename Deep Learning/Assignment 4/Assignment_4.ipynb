    "While TensorFlow shares some similarities with NumPy, it is not a drop-in replacement. The main differences between TensorFlow and NumPy are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Computational Graphs: TensorFlow uses a dataflow graph to represent computations, allowing for efficient execution on different devices such as CPUs and GPUs, and enabling distributed computing. NumPy performs computations directly without such graph abstraction.\n",

    "3. Automatic Differentiation: TensorFlow provides automatic differentiation capabilities through its computational graph, which is essential for training neural networks, while NumPy lacks built-in automatic differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. GPU Acceleration: TensorFlow offers seamless GPU acceleration, leveraging the computational power of GPUs for faster execution, whereas NumPy primarily relies on CPU computations.\n",

    "\n",
    "To ensure that a function can be converted to a TensorFlow Function (TF Function), you need to adhere to several rules and guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use TensorFlow Operations**: Ensure that the function's logic is implemented using TensorFlow operations (`tf` functions) rather than standard Python operations or functions from other libraries. This ensures that the function's computations can be efficiently executed within the TensorFlow runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Avoid Python Control Flow**: Avoid using standard Python control flow statements such as `if`, `for`, `while`, and `break` within the function. Instead, use TensorFlow equivalents like `tf.cond` and `tf.while_loop` for conditional logic and looping constructs. TensorFlow provides control flow operations that can be converted into their graph representation, enabling proper execution within TF Functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoid Python Objects with Mutable State**: Ensure that the function does not rely on Python objects with mutable state, such as lists, dictionaries, or class instances with mutable attributes. TF Functions require stateless execution to ensure deterministic behavior and proper serialization. Use TensorFlow tensors or variables for storing stateful information within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoid Side Effects**: Ensure that the function does not have side effects such as modifying global state, printing to stdout, or relying on external resources (e.g., file I/O, network operations) during its execution. Side effects can lead to non-deterministic behavior and prevent proper serialization of the function as a TF Function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use Static Shape Inference**: Provide explicit shape information for all TensorFlow tensors used within the function whenever possible. Static shape inference enables TensorFlow to optimize memory usage and execution efficiency by pre-allocating memory buffers and performing shape-based optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Avoid Dynamic Control Flow**: Minimize the use of dynamic control flow constructs that depend on the input data or other runtime conditions. While TensorFlow supports dynamic control flow operations (e.g., `tf.cond`, `tf.while_loop`), excessive use of dynamic control flow can hinder performance and complicate graph optimization.\n",

    "### Q11. When would you need to create a dynamic Keras model? How do you do that? Why not make all your models dynamic?\n",
    "\n",
    "You would need to create a dynamic Keras model when your model's architecture or behavior depends on runtime conditions, such as varying input shapes, conditional branching, or iterative processing. Dynamic models are particularly useful in scenarios such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variable-Length Inputs**: When your model needs to process inputs with varying lengths, such as sequences of different lengths in natural language processing or time series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conditional Branching**: When different parts of the model architecture need to be activated or deactivated based on certain conditions, such as attention mechanisms or adaptive network architectures.\n",

    "3. **Iterative Processing**: When the model requires iterative computation or dynamic state updates, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), iterative attention mechanisms, or graph neural networks (GNNs).\n",

    "Creating a dynamic Keras model involves using dynamic computation constructs provided by TensorFlow, such as `tf.function`, `tf.cond`, `tf.while_loop`, and `tf.TensorArray`, within custom layers or models. These constructs enable the model to adapt its behavior dynamically during runtime based on input data and other runtime conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all models need to be dynamic. Static models, where the architecture is fixed and does not change during runtime, offer certain advantages such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance Optimization**: Static models can be optimized more effectively by TensorFlow's graph compiler and runtime optimizations, leading to better performance and efficiency, especially on hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ease of Deployment**: Static models are easier to deploy and serve in production environments since their architecture is fixed and does not depend on runtime conditions. This simplifies model serving and deployment pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Graph Mode Optimization**: Static models can take advantage of graph mode optimization techniques such as graph pruning, constant folding, and graph-level optimizations, leading to faster execution and reduced memory footprint.\n",
    "\n",
