If the covariance is close to zero, it implies that there is little to no linear relationship between the variables. Mathematically, the covariance between two random variables \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) is calculated as: \\[ $\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})$ \\]"
